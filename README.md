# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
First venture into downloading and analyzing Tweets using Python

This is a part of the Data Science course on Coursera.
In this project I tackled a number of problems such as:
1. Compute the sentiment of each tweet based on the sentiment scores of the terms in the tweet. The sentiment of a tweet is equivalent to the sum of the sentiment scores for each term in the tweet.
2. Create a script that computes the sentiment for the terms that do not appear in the list of terms in the sentiments dictionary.
3. compute the term frequency histogram of the livestream data using the formula: 
[# of occurrences of the term in all tweets]/[# of occurrences of all terms in all tweets]
4. Analyze the sentiment of each tweet and obtain the name of the happiest state as a string. The state name can be extracted using various information available in a tweet.
5. compute the ten most frequently occurring hash tags from the tweet data.
